# AnimeVsCartoon

The main objective is to train an artificial neural network to classify anime and cartoons

## Dataset
The dataset is self-mined using Google Chrome's Fatkun Batch Image Downloader Extension.
The dataset contains around 6000 images with almost equal number of images of anime and cartoons

## Model 1
The model used is a convolutional neural network.

## Model 2
This model uses the initial pre-trained layers of VGG-19.

## Results
 # Model 1 
  Has a 96.07% training accuracy and a 86.67% test accuracy.
 # Model 2
  Has a 99% training accuracy and a 90% test accuracy.
  
## Future Scope
Facial features differ a lot in anime and cartoon. This fact can be exploited to build more efficient models.
